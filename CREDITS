Project Philosophy
------------------

Fox.ConfigKit embodies a set of core design principles that guide its development:

Fail-Fast Validation
  The library is built on the principle that configuration errors should be caught
  at application startup, not discovered at runtime. This design choice prevents
  cascading failures and provides immediate feedback to developers and operators.

Explicit Over Implicit
  All validation rules are explicitly declared using a fluent API, making the
  configuration contract clear and discoverable. There are no hidden validations
  or magic conventions—what you see is what you get.

Type Safety First
  Leveraging C#'s strong type system and modern language features (nullable
  reference types, expression trees, generic constraints), Fox.ConfigKit provides
  compile-time safety wherever possible, reducing the surface area for runtime
  errors.

Zero External Dependencies
  The library deliberately depends only on core Microsoft.Extensions packages
  (Options, DependencyInjection). This decision ensures long-term stability,
  reduces dependency conflicts, and maintains a minimal attack surface.

Developer Experience
  Clear error messages, IntelliSense-friendly APIs, and comprehensive XML
  documentation are first-class concerns. The library is designed to be intuitive
  for developers familiar with ASP.NET Core's IOptions pattern.


Architectural Decisions
------------------------

Fox.ConfigKit (Core Library)
  The core library provides a lightweight abstraction over Microsoft.Extensions.Options
  with three main components:

  1. Validation Rules - Composable, chainable validation primitives (NotNull,
     InRange, FileExists, etc.)
  2. Builder Pattern - ConfigValidationBuilder provides a fluent API for constructing
     validation pipelines
  3. Startup Integration - ValidateOnStartup() hooks into ASP.NET Core's startup
     lifecycle for fail-fast behavior

  The architecture deliberately avoids complex abstractions, favoring simple,
  testable components that compose well.

Fox.ConfigKit.ResultKit (Integration Package)
  This package bridges Fox.ConfigKit with Fox.ResultKit's Result pattern, enabling
  functional-style configuration validation for applications already using Railway
  Oriented Programming.

  Key design choice: The integration is opt-in and packaged separately to avoid
  forcing the Result pattern on users who prefer exception-based error handling.


Inspirations
------------

This project draws inspiration from:

  - Microsoft.Extensions.Options - The foundation for .NET configuration patterns
  - Railway Oriented Programming (Scott Wlaschin) - Fail-fast error handling principles
  - FluentValidation - Fluent API design patterns (though Fox.ConfigKit is purpose-built
    for startup validation, not runtime validation)
  - Domain-Driven Design - Explicit validation of invariants and fail-fast philosophy
